<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is the weblog of Justin Tulloss.</p>

<p>I am a software developer that dabbles in many areas of computing. I've done a bit of kernel and low level driver work in the past, but now I mostly concern myself with writing software that makes me happy. My favorite languages are JavaScript, C, and Python.</p>

<p>Besides developing software, I sometimes think about other things. In particular, economics and politics. I'm a libertarian most of the time, and I hope that's reflected in my writing.</p>

<p>My blog is on the harmonize.fm server because I co-founded harmonize.fm with Brian Smith. We've moved on to other things since then, but feel free to visit anyway at <a href="http://harmonize.fm">harmonize.fm</a>.</p>

<p>Since harmonize, I worked for a couple years at <a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a> on their <a href="http://developer.palm.com/">Mojo JavaScript application framework</a>. Now I'm at <a href="http://rdio.com" target="_blank">Rdio</a>, trying to finish what I started at harmonize.</p>

<p>If you really need to get ahold of me, email me at gmail. The name is justin.tulloss.</p>

At <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/">Real Clear Politics</a>, you can play with electoral maps based on current poll numbers and what you think is going to happen. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/">Try it now</a>, it's lots of fun!

So what do I think is going to happen? I think Obama is going to win. Naive, perhaps, but for the past four years, I've been surrounded by university liberals in Illinois, no less. How does he do it? Well, it's ridiculously close. I think Indiana and Florida are going to go McCain. In that case, Obama needs to grab both New Mexico and Colorado. Assuming he can do that, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan are going to be big battlegrounds. If Obama can win two of those, he'll win the election. I think he's going to do it.

<p>I arrived in San Francisco early this afternoon after spending an uneventful day and night on the road. Palm is putting me up in an apartment in downtown San Francisco for a month until I find a more permanent arrangement. The apartment is on the 25th floor of 26 in a mid-level high rise. It's a beautiful apartment. It's right in the financial district, which is perhaps too high rent and too low excitement for permanent living, but it's fantastic for the time being.</p>
<p>You can see two different views from the apartment here, as well as a picture of the living room. I played with the lighting a bit since it's just past dusk. I clearly have a lot of learning to do if I'm ever going to get the most out of this camera.<img src="http://justin.harmonize.fm/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pict1914.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="PICT1914.JPG" style="margin-top:10px; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:10px;" /> <img src="http://justin.harmonize.fm/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pict1916.jpg" width="360" height="480" alt="PICT1916.JPG" style="margin-top:10px; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:10px;" /></p>

title: Petition for Access to Publicly Funded Research

There's a [petition floating around][1] to require that any scientific
publication that comes from public funds be made available for free to the
public. This seems like a pretty good idea, but of course I'm skeptical of
anything that requires anybody to do anything.

Looking into this more, however, this petition seems restrained and reasonable.
It doesn't require unpublished or proprietary findings to be made public, or
for the entire research process to happen in the open. Only accepted scientific
publications will be opened up. The petition references the [NIH Public
Access][2] program, which requires that research be made public within 12
months after it's been accepted to a journal.

These requirements are pretty light. I don't think they would scare anybody
away from taking public research funds as published papers aren't secret,
and organizations that make their livings off of selling scientific articles
would still be able to do so for the first 12 months. After 12 months, all
those that really need to be able to keep up to date on research will have it
anyway, so why not make it public?

This seems to further the public knowledge without burdening anybody at all.
I think I'll sign.

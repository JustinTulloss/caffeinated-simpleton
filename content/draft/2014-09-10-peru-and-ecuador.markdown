title: Summer Travels Peru and Ecuador edition

Since the beginning of the summer, I've been having a great time exploring the beauty that's nearby and cheap to get to. Places like Yosemite, Austin, Zion, Portland, and of course San Francisco. But what's an extended hiatus from employment without some interational travel? After much debate about time and place, Soumya and I booked tickets to Peru, Ecuador, and back to SF. Then, months later, we planned our trip in a flurry and set off.

Getting to Cusco
----------------

The first destination on our trip was [Cusco, Peru][1]. Cusco is the beginning of the line for most trips to Machu Picchu, and our 5 day trek through Salkantay Pass promised to be the highlight of the trip. However, international airlines don't fly to Cusco; you first have to get to [Lima][2]. In an attempt to save money and avoid an international tax on buying local Peruvian airline tickets, we decided to wait til we were in Lima to purchase our tickets to Cusco.

That turned out to be a mistake. We ended up saving ~$40, but we lost 3 hours of time since we missed the first flight of the day and had to take the second. This was the beginning of my eventually hardened distaste for the Lima airport.

Cusco
-----

We had a couple of days to kill in Cusco before the beginning of our trek. Cusco is at something like 12,000 ft, so it's a good place to get used to the altitude before starting up a mountain pass. Cusco was the Inkan capital city that was taken by the Spanish who attempted to convert all the Inkan religious sites into Catholic ones, all while building their own, Spanish style churches. There were a lot of Inkan religious sites, so there were a lot of churches.

We weren't much for touring the cathedrals, but we were really into the cobblestone streets, the beautiful architecture, and just the differentness of the city. The setting, high up in the Andes mountains, is absolutely gorgeous. The people were friendly and helpful, if always looking to make a buck off the naive tourists.

We also had a great hike up to (TODO: What was the name of that place?), an old Inkan fortress, where we could see the entire city. There happened to be a huge rainbow which was amazing.

The next day we headed to El Molino (TODO: Check spelling) market where actual peruvians shop (rather than the touristy market nearby the town square). It was definitely a lot different. Most of the goods they sold were western goods (or knockoffs thereof), but everybody operated out of stalls that were about four square feet in size. And every vendor was competing with their neighbors; there would be 10 stalls all selling the exact same shoes, and then 10 more selling TVs, and then 10 more selling clothing. The whole place was massive and took up more than two city blocks, and youcould get anything there. There was meat, veggies, more potatoes than I knew existed. Clothing for everyday life, cold weather gear, warm weather gear, suits and dresses. There was coffee and coca leaves, haberdashers and shoe repair men (TODO: come up with the real word for that). There were stereos and cameras and DVDs and memory cards. There were laptops and monitors. There were DVDs and CDs. And neither of us took any pictures.

After the market we spent most of the day perparing for a our trek, which started early the next day. Soumya needed gloves, and we both wanted alpaca sweaters as another layer (they didn't have alpaca sweaters in the non-touristy areas, apparently it's strictly a tourist garment). We had a great time looking at all the various sweater options and haggling between the different vendors. They were basically all the same sweaters and all the same prices. What a racket.

Later, we, went to our orientation for the trek where they told us we had to be at the bus station at 3:30 AM. That put a damper on the night since we wanted to get some sleep that night which meant going to bed at, like, 9:30 PM. We still managed to find a great rotisserie chicken place for dinner, but then it was straight to bed.

Salkantay
---------

Our trek started with a long early morning bus ride from Cusco to Malfkd (TODO: fix that name). They took us to a place where it seems that all the treks start from and serves breakfast. We got there at 5:30 AM and they were barely awake themselves. It took over an hour to get our food, and almost 3 hours before we were actually off and on our way. It really seemed to us that we could have probably slept, like, three more hours.

The first day was pretty easy. We took a bus up a long dirt road, then walked for a while to our lunch spot.

Lunch was an amazing 4 course meal. This was the first in a series of excellent meals that I have no idea how the staff pulled off. We had a trained chef, and a host of mules that carried all the supplied for the camp. They had a tent to cook in and a full propane stove. Everything they made was absolutely top notch and we really never went hungry despite all the physical exertion.

After resting a bit, we hiked to a lake that was nearby but quite a bit uphill. It was good practice in climbing in high altitude. Then we came back to the lunch spot (which was our camp for the night), rested a bit more, had dinner and went to bed.

Everybody was exhausted after getting up so early and walking all day, so almost everybody was in bed by 8 PM. Soumya and I stayed up for a bit chatting (or at least trying to understand) the farmer whose land we were on and our guide, Silvio. The farmer and his son had made a nice fire, which was great since it was really cold that night. We did need to be awake at 5:00 AM the next day, so we didn't stay up too late either.

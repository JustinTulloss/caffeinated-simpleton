Welcome to my personal blog! My old personal blog was deleted without warning, so I'm starting a new one here. I'm freeloading off of the harmonize.fm server, but as it's my company's server, and the company is 49% mine, I don't think they'll mind.Â 

I've started this blog because now that I'm not working on harmonize for ridiculous hours and searching for a job doesn't take huge amounts of time, I have more time to write. In addition, I'm trying to learn Erlang to a much deeper level and I think that I might have some things to say in that process.

I hope you enjoy it!

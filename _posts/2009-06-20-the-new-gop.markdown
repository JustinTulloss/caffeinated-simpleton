  content: This is spot-on, but I think Republicans are going to have to lose at least
    one more presidential election before really getting this lesson into their heads.

  content: I agree. There&#39;s no way the party remakes itself to the point it can
    beat<br>Obama in 4 years. The only hope is if Obama screws up, and, personally,
    I<br>really don&#39;t want that to happen.

  content: I&#39;d love to see these things happen, and some of them might happen.  But
    I cannot see the GOP anytime in the near future separating itself from the religious
    right.  It&#39;s such an organized, united, huge group of supporters that financially
    it might not make sense for them to cut ties publicly.

  content: I don&#39;t think they need to publicly cut ties with the religious right;
    I think the religious right should still be a part of the party. However, their
    rhetoric should be removed from the platform. I don&#39;t see it happening as
    a public decision, more of an increasing number of viable candidates simply not
    using the language.

  content: 'The Democrats did try, only the Republicans didn''t.  Not to be partisan
    here, but that is preilsecy what happened.To convice the Republicans to pass the
    debt ceiling, President Obama came up with a budget plan that cut $4 trillion
    from the budget and added $1 trillion in revenue (a 1% increase in taxes on the
    uber-rich), and made cuts to Social Security and Medicare but did not get rid
    of either.The Democrats in Congress came up with a plan that cut $3 trillion from
    the budget, did absolutely no tax hikes, and left Medicare and Social Security
    alone.The Republicans came up with a plan that cut $1.5 trillion from the budget
    ($2.5 trillion less than Obama''s plan, $1.5 trillion less than the Democrat plan,
    and $500 billion less than the plan that eventually passed Congress), did no tax
    hikes, and got rid of Social Security and Medicare entirely.If Republicans had
    been serious about cutting spending to pass the debt ceiling, they would have
    jumped at Obama''s plan, which lowered the deficit by $5 trillion.  Even the ones
    against tax hikes would have jumped at the Democrat plan, which cut twice as much
    as the Republican plan and did it with no tax hikes.Republicans were out for two
    things to get rid of Social Security and Medicare, and to deny President Obama
    a possible victory even at the cost of the American economy we are now seeing
    the economic effects of their efforts to defeat Obama.  The Republicans wanted
    to keep the support of the TEA Party, and they sacrificed America to do it._______________Edit:Sorry,
    Neil, but it was Obama who had that plan, NOT the Republicans.  The Republicans
    blocked the plan that cut $4 trillion not because it did tax hikes but because
    it did not get rid of Social Security and Medicare and because it would allow
    Obama to take some credit for saving America.References :'

  content: You know what this current crowd of GOP liars want is to turn the United
    Sates into China, where only a few giant canropotiors run things, they own the
    factories, that apartments, the grocery stores, the gas stations, the newspaper
    and magazine publications, the radio stations, the television stations and you
    pay them and they get all the benefits, and if you do not like it go jump off
    cliff. Well some Chinese workers seeing that as individuals that they cannot progress
    have done just that by committing suicide. The current crowd of GOP liars want
    to abolish Medicare from the elderly, they want to abolish a woman's right to
    choose and have control over her own body, they want to abolish collective bargaining
    rights, and on top of it all they want to blame the middle class and public sector
    workers for a recession that they created, while their beloved  Fat cats  continue
    to pay themselves exorbitant salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits. Yes this is the
    GOP  Radical Right-Wing Social Engineering  that they dream about. New York was
    the beginning but the next will be Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and
    later the other states of our nation. The GOP real failed so all the can do is
    double down and try to save some face, the retirees will finish them off if they
    keep it up.

  content: 'Of course the young voetrs must turn out for the Dems to maintain majorities.  But
    Mike you point out the MSM fallacy of Democratic voetrs suffering from an ethusiasm
    gap, which you yourself bought into in the beginning, as did ALL of the ROF men
    when you were scolding progressives for not being appreciative enough.  You should''ve
    done a little research yourself before taking us to task.  Just thought I''d mention
    that.No surprise that conservatives as children were whiny brats who tried to
    manipulate their environment even then.  But as John Dean points out in his great
    book  Conservatives Without Conscience - these are the same types who need an
    authortarian leader as Sue backs up in her post. That''s why these losers will
    turn a blind eye or deaf ear to anything their chosen  daddys  do or say as long
    as they percieve they are being taken care of.Sue wrote: The teabagger candidates
    and their glassy eyed fanatic followers remind me so much of 1930s Germany. Some
    one on the Huff Po mentioned exactly that very thing. As far as Juan Williams
    he is just like Michael Steele. They are paid political whores who will sell their
    soul for the next buck.'

Speculating about the future of the Republican party has become a popular conversation amongst the political pundits. The most popular discussions revolve around who will be the face of the rebranded GOP that will inevitably come about. That isn't a very interesting topic. In all probability, the big names now will fade and a fresh, charismatic politician will emerge onto the scene and carry the new platform forward.  The more important issue is deciding what that platform will look like. There are a few things that must be in that platform to be successful.
<h3>Renounce the Religious Right</h3>
The religious right is the worst thing to happen to the GOP. There is nothing wrong with their beliefs, I am a Christian myself, but their desire to impose those beliefs on the rest of the country gets them nothing but resentment and a reputation for narrow-minded ignorance. It is vitally important that the influence of this group is greatly reduced or removed entirely. Their needs can be met by the party without their face being on it.
<h3>Make Peace with the Gay Community</h3>
While it's true that gay rights don't have popular support, the active opposition of them by the Republican party makes them look, for lack of a better word, mean. To undo this damage, Republicans should start vehemently defending personal rights from intrusion by the government. This goes along with the principles of small government that Republicans are supposedly for. Government intrusion into peoples lives should be kept to a minimum, and when it is unclear whether a person has a right to do something, err in favor of the right. A Republican that can defend the rights of every citizen, gay or not, will come across as much more principled than somebody writing anti-gay marriage bills just because they know it will pass.
<h3>Take Back National Security</h3>
The Republican dominance of national security issues took a big hit during the Bush administration. Whether or not Bush's strategies are vindicated, the Republican party still needs to repair the immediate damage to their reputation. One way to draw a clear line between the two parties is free trade. The democratic caucus is too diversified to take a strong position on free trade, and Republicans would be well advised to exploit the clear links between trade and security.
<h3>Get a Pragmatic Energy Policy</h3>
Republicans don't have anything to say about energy. They need to find something. Whether they align themselves with the Democrats or strike out and find something new, the "drill at home" argument isn't going to cut it. An underrepresented energy policy that the Republicans could take up is one oriented around nuclear power. By simultaneously pushing for nuclear power plants and for more electic motors, their policy would be easy to understand and very green.
<h3>Win Back the Latino Vote</h3>
The Republicans should have the Latino vote. Their small business support and smart economic policies should speak to Latinos. However, the immigration debate has aliented large numbers of them. The Republicans should come out with a sensible immigration bill that puts amnesty at the top. A party oriented around less goverment interference in people's lives should apply those principles to any person who wants to be an American.
<h3>Find a Good Tone</h3>
One of the biggest differences between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats tend to regulate and Repulicans tend to incentivize. This is a point that works well for Republicans. If they can show that they are trying to acheive the same goals as the rest of the country but want to leave choice in the equation, they can almost always win the debate against somebody trying to achieve those goals through force. People do not like to be forced into things, and the Republicans won't do it. They'll just charge you a bit.
<h3>Stop Being Corrupt</h3>
Every Republican that gets caught in some corruption scheme or affair reflects poorly on the entire party. Democrats have this problem too, but since they are in power, it will probably be happening more often to them for a while. If the Republicans can have a few scandal free years, they can emerge as the honest brokers for the people. Trust is probably the most important thing you can have in politics, and the Republicans have some time to earn theirs back.

If the Republicans can do these few things, as well as define clear and workable alternative plans for hot issues like education and health care reform, they will be able to compete again. Where the Republican party is currently associated with hate, foolish wars, closed borders, guns, and rednecks, a few smart changes could position them as the party defending the people from government encroachment, accepting of every person, and ready to do what it takes to keep Americans safe and prosperous. That's a party people can vote for, and one that we haven't had in a very long time. Perhaps losing power was the best thing to ever happen to the GOP.

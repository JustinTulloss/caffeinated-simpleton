Today I took some time to move my blog to [Jekyll][1]. There are a few reasons
why I decided to do this.

 - After shutting down the harmonize.fm server, I had to re-set up [WordPress][2].
   That sucked.
 - I hate maintaining WordPress and I hate trying to change the style.
 - I want to start experimenting with [SPDY][4] and other frontend delivery
   techniques, and WordPress doesn't make that easy.

I didn't really want to use Jekyll since I'm not a big [Ruby][3] fan, but there's
no reason for static content to not be static, and Jekyll is currently the best
tool out there to fulfill that ideal.

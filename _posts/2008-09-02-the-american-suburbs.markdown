  content: Don&#39;t forget to include Australia in your comparisons..   <br>Possibly
    the fact that cities could be built where-ever was required - and not for historical
    reasons?  Australia has so much of it&#39;s population tied up in the state capitals
    - everything else barely rates mention as a "city".  (And by city - I&#39;m mainly
    referring to the sprawling suburbs around the outside)  Just looked up wikipedia
    an 12 million out of 12 million people live in our 5 biggest cities!<br><br><br><a

  content: I&#39;ve actually been thinking a LOT about this lately.  I watched a TED
    video somewhere about this exact issue.  Their observation dealt entirely with
    public spaces.  In American suburbs, we&#39;ve completely destroyed the idea that
    people can commune in a public space, even to the point that there isn&#39;t anyplace
    to be proud of inside suburbs anymore.<br><br>For example, walk through a European
    city and you will find many public spots that are even filled with shopping spots.  These
    spots all push right up against the sidewalk and promote a social atmosphere.  Contrast
    this to a typical American suburb and the difference is staggering.  These spots
    simply do not exist at all.  The trouble is, it would be TRIVIAL to have places
    like this.  Many small businesses try to make themselves look more professional
    by putting a few steps up to the building, maybe throwing some shrubs or plants
    in front of the building.  This is exactly the wrong thing to do.  <br><br>A bit
    of a rant, but I think this problem is solvable within our lifetimes.  We just
    need to promote public spaces that are clean, fun, and easy to get to.  It might
    even solve itself.

  content: I agree with the point about public spaces. However, I&#39;m not so optimistic
    about solving it. Unless there&#39;s a really huge backlash from our generation
    (as one of the first to really grow up entirely in the suburbs), I think we&#39;re
    just going to see more of the same.<br><br>My solution is to try living in the
    city, at least while I&#39;m young and single.

  content: they would add more fresh water to the process and this cetlainry freed
    us from any odour for the following three days!!  On another occassion, after
    I had to relocate an outdoor dinner party due to the bad smell, they were able
    to explain that the odour was related to some industrial cleaning they had been
    conducting on the site.  Perhaps they could have given residents some advance
    warning that this would be occurring! While we await the construction of the new
    mill   could not further measures be taken to ensure greater community consultation
    and further reduce offensive odours!!

Many of my friends and myself feel that the American suburb is a terrible thing. The houses are all the same, the restaurants are all chains, the stores are all warehouses, and the people are all fake. I had the privilege of growing up in a neighborhood that viciously guarded its downtown. This town was not as bad as many suburban towns, but it was still slowly falling into becoming the typical American suburb.

So where did we go wrong? Europe is as advanced as we are and has largely managed to avoid the big box stores and especially the subdivisions. They have retained their neighborly villages and it's still possible to find a place to eat that makes the village specialty. Hell, it may have invented the village specialty. What is so different about America that has created this suburban culture?

In short, I'm too young to know. However, no one is too young to guess. I've hypothesized a few things below, let me know what you think.
<ul>
	<li>Land values in Europe went up before there were cars. If land outside your village was prohibitively expensive when it became practical to move out of the village, you may not have done so. In contrast, land in America has always been cheap on average.</li>
	<li>Europeans like good food. They're just raised with more sophisticated tastes and wouldn't tolerate chain restaurants.</li>
	<li>High inner city crime drove people out of population centers. The US had very high crime rates earlier in the 20th century. Perhaps respectable people needed to get out.</li>
	<li>Bussing reduced the quality of inner city schools. With people afraid to send their children to schools of questionable quality, those with means and desire left the cities. This left only poor and disrupted children in the cities, which inevitably lead to a worse educational system, forcing more people to leave.</li>
	<li>Home ownership became a status symbol. It's hard to own land in the city, if owning a home became something to shoot for, the suburbs would be very attractive.</li>
</ul>
That's all I've got right now. Does anybody have any better ideas? How did America become Suburbia?

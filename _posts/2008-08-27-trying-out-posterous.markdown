  content: Not sure why it&#39;s so small.... Maybe I&#39;ll fix it, or maybe that&#39;s
    the last you&#39;ll hear of posterous.

  content: Apple Macbook is different from the rest of the loatpp because of its Mac
    OS X. It is built ontop of unix, which is a stable and secure OS. Thus users can
    have a better operating environment. Less or almost no crashes and no active virus
    as on the date of the post. So you won't regret getting a macbook.

  content: I agree. A boss at a local business gealenrly doesn't have to deal with
    parents complaining about their employee getting a bad performance review. He
    also has the luxury of being a higher priority to his employees(job=money=food,
    clothing, housing)than we are to our students (education=boring, stupid, everyone's
    out to get me).

  content: Another good question to ask is whetehr or not City residents are getting
    what we pay for. With all of the parked cars and no interest in enforcing existing
    parking  regulations for RVs, boats, trailers and old cars particularly on street
    sweeping day  are we really getting what we are now paying for on our trash bill?
    Also, since street sweeping is on the trash bill, is everyone getting street sweeping
    service? Do they sweep the entire City? It might be a Prop 218 issue if you are
    paying for a service that you are not actually getting. I live on Fulton and there
    are too many parked cars to get the service that we are required to pay for. The
    sweeper skips most of the street. I think the City Council even voted against
    parking enforcement on street sweeping day. How do we opt out?

<div dir="ltr">Posterous.com has a lightweight blogging platform that allows you to write blogs by sending an email. It's really cool, they support images, video, and everything else you would expect. There goes my idea of learning Cocoa by writing a Mac OS X blogging client. Gmail works just fine.</div>

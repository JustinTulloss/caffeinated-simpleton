title: Summer Travels Peru and Ecuador edition
---

Since the beginning of the summer, I've been having a great time exploring the beauty that's nearby and cheap to get to. Places like Yosemite, Austin, Zion, Portland, and of course San Francisco. But what's an extended hiatus from employment without some interational travel? After much debate about time and place, Soumya and I booked tickets to Peru, Ecuador, and back to SF. Then, months later, we planned our trip in a flurry and set off.

Getting to Cusco
----------------

The first destination on our trip was [Cusco, Peru][1]. Cusco is the beginning of the line for most trips to Machu Picchu, and our 5 day trek through Salkantay Pass promised to be the highlight of the trip. However, international airlines don't fly to Cusco; you first have to get to [Lima][2]. In an attempt to save money and avoid an international tax on buying local Peruvian airline tickets, we decided to wait til we were in Lima to purchase our tickets to Cusco.

That turned out to be a mistake. We ended up saving ~$40, but we lost 3 hours of time since we missed the first flight of the day and had to take the second. This was the beginning of my eventually hardened distaste for the Lima airport.

Cusco
-----

We had a couple of days to kill in Cusco before the beginning of our trek. Cusco is at something like 12,000 ft, so it's a good place to get used to the altitude before starting up a mountain pass. Cusco was the Inkan capital city that was taken by the Spanish who attempted to convert all the Inkan religious sites into Catholic ones, all while building their own, Spanish style churches. There were a lot of Inkan religious sites, so there were a lot of churches.

We weren't much for touring the cathedrals, but we were really into the cobblestone streets, the beautiful architecture, and just the differentness of the city. The setting, high up in the Andes mountains, is absolutely gorgeous. The people were friendly and helpful, if always looking to make a buck off the naive tourists.

We also had a great hike up to (TODO: What was the name of that place?), an old Inkan fortress, where we could see the entire city. There happened to be a huge rainbow which was amazing.

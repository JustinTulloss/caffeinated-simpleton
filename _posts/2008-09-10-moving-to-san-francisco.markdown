My brief stint between Champaign and life has ended, and tomorrow I will be leaving from Stow, OH with my trusty Honda Civic packed to the brim. I'll stop by my grandparents' for a night and then head to Champaign to watch my dear Fighting Illini take on the fearsome Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns.

After what promises to be a fun-filled weeked, I've got several days to wander through the west in search of San Franciso. Stop back throughout the next week for updates on my progress and, of course, pictures of the beautiful American west.
